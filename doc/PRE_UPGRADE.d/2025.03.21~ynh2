Sad news: since https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/releases/tag/250425-21ddba459, armv7 versions are not part anymore of the regular releases of Photoprism.

Rasberry Pis with armv7 hardware will not be able to update automatically from YunoHost.

Normally, there will still be releases avalaible for those devices, but it will be more randomly.

So if you have this hardware and wants to be able to update in the future, please create an issue https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/photoprism_ynh. Thanks.
